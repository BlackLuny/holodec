hmm

add registers to return statement

how to
labeling and phi node insertion???


method 1
reduce each register to its base register
then generate phi nodes for these parent registers

problem:

al = 1
ah = 2
ax = append(ah,al)
ax = phi(ax)
al = split(ax,0,8)
ah = split(ax,8,8)
xx = op(al,ah)


insertion of phi nodes
first reduce everything to parent register
with splits and extends
then use 


method 2
we assume that registers are used as they are defed
example:

al = 1
ah = 2
--- bb boundary ---
al = phi(al)
ah = phi(ah)
xx = op(al,ah)

and not like this

al = 1
ah = 2
--- bb boundary ---
al = phi(al)
ah = phi(ah)
ax = append(ah,al)
xx = op(ax)
